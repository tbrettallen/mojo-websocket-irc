Running the examples

For non websocket native browsers, you need a flash policy server running
(port 843, so it needs to run as root)

sudo ./script/flash-policy-server &

then you can run the examples

Note, when running these examples, you shouldn't use http://localhost:3000/
Instead use 127.0.0.1 or another ip local to your box.  Chrome will just refuse to
connect to localhost (or used to?)

Simple IRC Client

The server proxies to irc.perl.org, and drops you in #test (you can /join #mojo if you'd like)

./script/websocket-irc-example-1

Then open http://127.0.0.1:3000/

You might want to open multiple tabs or something to talk to yourself
